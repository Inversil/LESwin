--Release 1.2--
Didn't think there was going to be another massive content update to LES, yet here we are.

	- Press Alt + C while hovering over a track to recolour the track's clips.
Project time tracker! Les will now track how much time you spend on a project. To check out how much time you've spent, simple click "Project Time" in the tray.
	- The project time tracker only clocks your time when you're actively using Live. Time spent browsing reddit in your browser is not going to add up to the talley :)
	- Though, if you want the timer to cut you some slack, you can disable "Strict Time" in the tray.
Rewrite of the settings.ini parser. It's now faster and less prone to telling you to reset randomly

Fixed a bug where LES would click on a random spot
Fixed a bug where the changelog wouldn't properly update

--Release 1.2.1--
More options is always better!

WINDOWS:
The plugin menu should now ALWAYS adds items properly, even if you're in a huge project and your computer is being unresponsive and slow.
The show automation lanes shortcut now also works even if you're using Live in different languages.
Added the ability to disable the Ctrl + W command.

MACOS:
Added the ability to disable the absolute duplicate commands.
Added the ability to disable the Ctrl + W command.
Made the piano roll macro error much more friendly looking (with added instructions!).
The show automation lanes shortcut now also works even if you're using Live in different languages.

--Release 1.2.2--

WINDOWS:
Improved 10.1 compatibility
Slightly better menu performance since 1.2.2
You can now close VST3 container windows with Ctrl + W (and Ctrl + Alt + W)
Clear track (Alt + X) now works on all languages
Save as new version (Ctrl + Alt + S) now works on all languages again

MACOS:
Improved 10.1 compatibility
Clear track (Option + X) now works on all languages
Save as new version (Cmd + Alt + S) now works on all languages
Improved absolute duplicate (Cmd + Alt + S and Cmd + Alt + D) performance and reliability
Both of these absolute duplicate commands now work on all langages
Place track marker (Alt + L) now works on all languages
Added a fallback shortcut for opening the plugin menu (Cmd + Shift + H)

--1.3--
Fixed middle click to pan on logitech office mice, including all mice in the MX master series.
the search query is now always properly cleared, even when loading large vsts; without using the overly complicated bookmark feature.
it's time for VST specific shortcuts!
VST specific shortcuts can be toggled on and off in the settings.
Xfer Serum:
	- use the 1,2,3 and 4 key to switch tabs between osc, fx, matrix and global respectively.

Kilohearts Phaseplant:
	- Alt A adds an analog oscillator to the patch
	- Alt N adds a noise oscillator to the patch
	- Alt S adds a sampler to the patch
	- Alt W adds a wavetable oscillator to the patch
	- Alt D adds a distortion "oscillator" to the patch
	- Alt O adds an output to the patch

	- Alt E adds an envelope to the modulation section
	- Alt L adds an LFO to the modulation section

Fabfilter Pro Q 3:
	- For some reason Ableton Live doesn't properly communicate undo's to pro Q. This macro fixes undo and redo actions inside the plugin by remapping the undo and redo shortcuts to click the buttons at the top.
	- Since I'm not a magician, the undos and redos will behave jank as usual when the plugin window is unfocussed.

Sylenth1:
	- use the 1 and 2 keys to switch between A and B tabs. (Although it's a toggle so you can also just hit 1 constantly)

Added more safety checks to shortcuts so you can't trigger them out of context as much.
**Added an option to increase scrolling speed, scroll around faster by changing the value in settings.ini**
Removed "superspeedmode" from the settings. LES has been stable enough for a while to the point that it's no longer nescesary to have a toggle for this.
Removed the safe automation open shortcut. Changes to the 10.1 context menus cause it to malfunction too often.
Changed a japanese word in the black midi easter egg joke so it means "death" rather than telling the users to "die"

--1.3.1--
(a broken beta that was never released)
--1.3.2--
depricated the vst shortcuts bound to the number keys.
Added a button to install InsertWhere, a M4L companion plugin that changes where plugins are inserted. (Thank you Mat Zo!)
	Hit the "Install InsertWhere" to extract the plugin.
	To use InsertWhere, place the plugin on your master channel. It will now change the location where plugins are auto inserted.
	If the location is set to "right", plugins will be autoinserted to the right of the one you have selected, rather than at the end.
	Set insertwhere to "end" to mimmick default behavior.
	Insertwhere's buttons can be keymapped, and the included oscillator can be used to hear which setting it is currently set to, without looking at the UI.
	
	If you want to use InserWhere on a Mac, please click [here](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/202817364264222720/805140617289138176/InsertWhere.amxd)

Attempted to fix a problem where the mouse would get stuck on middle click to pan. Let me know how that *pans* out.
Fixed a problem where alt+x cleartracks would not work right on the new Live 11 Beta (thank you bmason12149!)
Implemented a function in settings.ini where you can switch the fucntions of shift + tab and tab around. (thank you bmason12149!)
