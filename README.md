This is the repository for the source code of the Live Enhancement Suite for Windows.

LES on windows is a compiled ahk script.
In order to run the source code, install Auto Hotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com

This git is for looking around and potentially adding changes; If people do something cool I'll definitely include it in the main dist.
There’s documentation included inside the source code.
CompileAHK version 2.0 can be used to replicate the compiled master version of LES.
you can get the latest version of compileAHK here: https://github.com/mercury233/compile-ahk

After installing, simply right click the .ahk file and select "compile with options"

Feel free to message me on twitter or discord InvertedSilence#9999 if you want to talk to me about this gir. Alternatively, you can email me at yo@invertedsilence.com, but emails tend to not be as fast as text messages :-)
