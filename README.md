# Live Enhancement Suite (Captain Hack)
I love LES, it makes Live so much better. Sadly, after the 1.3 release, I started experiencing side effects from some of the new features.
So, like any open source software that I can change to suite my needs, I have.

As I go, I'll be stripping it down to just the features I use, so don't expect this to mirror the full LES release. Removed functionality can be found in the [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

Please note: While this version works great for me, it may totally fail for you.

## Warranty
I can't gaurantee any other author's work included in this project. I can gaurantee that I personally have not contributed anything malicious.
To the best of my knowlege this script is safe, but use of it is strictly at your own risk.

## Original Readme
This is the repository for the source code of the Live Enhancement Suite for Windows.

LES on windows is a compiled ahk script.
In order to run the source code, install Auto Hotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com

This git is for looking around and potentially adding changes; If people do something cool I'll definitely include it in the main dist.
Thereâ€™s documentation included inside the source code.
CompileAHK can be used to replicate the compiled master version of LES.

I'm not sure if this is the best approach for this, so let me know if you want me to set this up differently.

Feel free to message me on twitter or discord InvertedSilence#9999 if you want to talk to me about this gir. Alternatively, you can email me at yo@invertedsilence.com, but emails tend to not be as fast as text messages :-)
