Two new shortcuts  (just don't use these on groups!):

	- Press Alt + C while hovering over a track to recolour the track's clips.
Project time tracker! Les will now track how much time you spend on a project. To check out how much time you've spent, simple click "Project Time" in the tray.
	- The project time tracker only clocks your time when you're actively using Live. Time spent browsing reddit in your browser is not going to add up to the talley :)
	- Though, if you want the timer to cut you some slack, you can disable "Strict Time" in the tray.
Rewrite of the settings.ini parser. It's now faster and less prone to telling you to reset randomly

More options is always better!

WINDOWS:
The plugin menu should now ALWAYS adds items properly, even if you're in a huge project and your computer is being unresponsive and slow.
The show automation lanes shortcut now also works even if you're using Live in different languages.
Added the ability to disable the Ctrl + W command.

MACOS:
Added the ability to disable the absolute duplicate commands.
Added the ability to disable the Ctrl + W command.
Made the piano roll macro error much more friendly looking (with added instructions!).
The show automation lanes shortcut now also works even if you're using Live in different languages.

--Release 1.2.2--

WINDOWS:
Improved 10.1 compatibility
Slightly better menu performance since 1.2.2
You can now close VST3 container windows with Ctrl + W (and Ctrl + Alt + W)
Clear track (Alt + X) now works on all languages
Save as new version (Ctrl + Alt + S) now works on all languages again

MACOS:
Improved 10.1 compatibility
Clear track (Option + X) now works on all languages

Improved absolute duplicate (Cmd + Alt + S and Cmd + Alt + D) performance and reliability
Both of these absolute duplicate commands now work on all langages
Place track marker (Alt + L) now works on all languages
Added a fallback shortcut for opening the plugin menu (Cmd + Shift + H)

--1.3--
Fixed middle click to pan on logitech office mice, including all mice in the MX master series.
the search query is now always properly cleared, even when loading large vsts; without using the overly complicated bookmark feature.
Added Buplicate!
	- Use Ctrl + B to duplicate something 7 times! Press Ctrl + B again on the same element duplicate again 8 times!
	- Quickly duplicate an initial single clip in blocks of Eight
	- It's more useful than you'd think

it's time for VST specific shortcuts!

Xfer Serum:
	- use the 1,2,3 and 4 key to switch tabs between osc, fx, matrix and global respectively.

Fabfilter Pro Q 3:
	- For some reason Ableton Live doesn't properly communicate undo's to pro Q. This macro fixes undo and redo actions inside the plugin by remapping the undo and redo shortcuts to click the buttons at the top.
	- Since I'm not a magician, the undos and redos will behave jank as usual when the plugin window is unfocussed.

Kick 2:
	- The same thing as pro-q, except for Kick 2

Sylenth1:
	- use the 1 and 2 keys to switch between A and B tabs. (Although it's a toggle so you can also just hit 1 constantly)

Massive:
	- Use keys 1 through 5 to mute and unmute oscillators 1 through 5 (this includes PM/RM and noise)

Phase Plant (BETA):
- These shortcuts are disabled and will not work unless a cheat is entered. 
There is a problem with them that I cannot figure out how to fix, but I left them in in case someone wants to play around with them.
- If you want to access the Phaseplant shortcuts, enable debug mode in the settings. Then, spam press hit both shift keys at once while in ableton live to open the cheat menu.
Enter "kilohearts" to enable the shortcuts.

	Use Alt + A to add an analog oscillator
	Use Alt + N to add a noise oscillator
	Use Alt + S to add a sample oscillator
	Use Alt + W to add a wavetable oscillator
	Use Alt + D to add a distortion oscillator
	Use Alt + F to add a filter oscillator
	Use Alt + O to add an output.
	
	Use Alt + L to add an LFO
	Use Alt + E to add an Envelope

VST specific shortcuts can be toggled on and off in the settings.
Ctrl + F1 or the PAUSE key can be used to toggle LES functionality on and off with ease.
	- you can toggle LES off if a VST shortcut is conflicting with something else you want to do

Added more safety checks to shortcuts so you can't trigger them out of context as much.
**Added an option to increase scrolling speed, scroll around faster by changing the value in settings.ini**
Removed "superspeedmode" from the settings. LES has been stable enough for a while to the point that it's no longer nescesary to have a toggle for this.
Removed the safe automation open shortcut. Changes to the 10.1 context menus cause it to malfunction too often.
Changed a japanese word in the black midi easter egg joke so it means "death" rather than telling the users to "die"
